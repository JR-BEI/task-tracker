# CLAUDE.md - Task Tracker

## Project Overview
A simple task tracking app to learn Claude Code patterns: sub-agents, MCPs, and controlled UX.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React 18 + TypeScript (strict) + Vite
- **Styling:** CSS (we'll add Tailwind later if needed)
- **Testing:** Playwright (e2e)

## File Structure
```
/
├── CLAUDE.md              ← Global agent (you are here)
├── SESSION.md             ← Session continuity
├── src/
│   ├── features/          ← Domain features (each gets a sub-agent)
│   │   └── tasks/         ← Task management feature
│   ├── components/        ← Shared UI components
│   └── App.tsx            ← Main app component
└── tests/
    └── e2e/               ← Playwright tests
```

## Conventions
- **Components:** PascalCase, one per file (`TaskCard.tsx`)
- **Hooks:** camelCase with `use` prefix (`useTaskState.ts`)
- **Types:** PascalCase (`TaskStatus`)
- **Test IDs:** `data-testid="feature-element"` (e.g., `task-card`, `task-submit-btn`)

## State Machine Pattern
Every interactive component defines its states BEFORE implementation:
- What states can it be in?
- What triggers transitions?

## Working With Me
- Speed over perfection - ship it, iterate
- Small focused changes
- Ask before big refactors
- "Just make it work" = skip edge cases for now

## Current Focus
- Setting up project structure
- Learning agent patterns
